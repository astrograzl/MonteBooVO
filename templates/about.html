<h3>MonteBoo <small>Virtual Observatory</small></h3>
<p class="lead">
  MonteBooVO is not only a web application for easy creation of artificial
  astronomy FITS images. It use mainly but not only the newly created module
  <code>artificial</code> from the famous piece of also free and open source
  astronomy software named <strong>Munipack</strong>. You can use it
  for simulation of precise astrometry and photometry observation.
  For more detailed information please read the <em>Help</em> section.
  Now let's have some fun!</p>

<h3>Munipack <small>A general astronomical image processing software.</small></h3>
<p class="lead">
  Munipack's goal is to develop easy-to-use tools for both astronomical
  astrometry and photometry along with additional utilities like to access
  of Virtual observatory or to provide various FITS files operations.

<h3>Fitspng <small>Fitspng is an utility intended to convert of images
  in astronomical FITS to PNG format.</small></h3>
<p class="lead">
  FITS format is a general purpose astronomical format offering images in high
  dynamical range (naturally including HDR). The primary goal of fitspng
  is to transform of the high dynamic range images to a limited numerical range
  of PNG format. The transformation uses global tone mapping by a set of tone
  functions with machine estimated or user provided scaling parameters.</p>

<h3>CFITSIO <small>A FITS File Subroutine Library</small></h3>
<p class="lead">
  CFITSIO is a library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and writing
  data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format. CFITSIO
  provides simple high-level routines for reading and writing FITS files that
  insulate the programmer from the internal complexities of the FITS format.
  CFITSIO also provides many advanced features for manipulating and filtering
  the information in FITS files.
